<h4>ARIMA</h4>

The ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving averages) models are commonly known as the Boxâ€“Jenkins approach. When fitting an ARIMA model to a set of time series data, the following procedure provides a useful general approach.

<ol>
<li>Plot the data. Identify any unusual observations.</li>
<li>If necessary, transform the data (using a Box-Cox transformation) to stabilize the variance.</li>
<li>If the data are non-stationary: take first differences of the data until the data are stationary.</li>
<li>Examine the ACF/PACF: Is an AR(p) or MA(q) model appropriate?</li>
<li>Try your chosen model(s), and use the AICc to search for a better model.</li>
<li>Check the residuals from your chosen model by plotting the ACF of the residuals, and doing a portmanteau test of the residuals. If they do not look like white noise, try a modified model. </li>
<li>Once the residuals look like white noise, calculate forecasts.</li>
</ol>
