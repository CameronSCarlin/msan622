<h4>Understanding Cash Flow Statement</h4>

<p>The cash flow statement has three sections, cash flow generated by or used by operations, cash flow generated by or used by investing activities, and cash flow generated by or used by financing activities.</p>


<p><strong>Cash flow generated by or used by operations</strong> reflects the cash produced by (or used by) the company's ongoing operations. Cash flow generated by (or used by) operations is one of the most important numbers on the cash flow statement, because it is the cash available from ongoing operations to reinvest in the business, repay debt, pay dividends, etc.</p>


<p><strong>Cash generated by or used by investing activities</strong> includes capital expenditures (often called additions to property and equipment), acquisitions or sales of businesses or property for cash, and other investing activities. Most often it will be a negative number dominated by spending on capital projects but, depending on the nature of the business, that is not always the case. </p>


<p><strong>Cash inflows in financing activities</strong> could come from, among other things, bank borrowings, debt issuance, and the sale of equity. Uses of cash for financial purposes include principal payments on debt, share repurchases and cash dividend payments.</p>

<h4>What to Look for?</h4>

<p>In evaluating a company's three year cash-flow performance consider the following: </p>

<ul>
  <li>First, do its operations consistently generate cash and what is the trend of this figure? Ideally, you would like to see solidly positive cash flow generated by operations. If this number is growing each year, that's even better. </li>
  <li>Second, to what extent is cash generated by operations sufficient to pay annual capital expenditures and cash dividends? This figure (cash flow from operations net of capital expenditures and dividends) is sometimes called free cash flow. This is a very useful measure because it tells you how much cash a company has left over each year, after reinvesting in its business and paying its shareholders, to take advantage of additional growth opportunities, increase the dividend, repurchase stock, or just put away for a rainy day. As a result, this figure can give you an idea of a company's ability to weather a slowdown or a downturn, to grow its business long term, and to maintain and grow its dividend.</li>
</ul>
