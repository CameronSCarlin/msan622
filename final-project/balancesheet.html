<h4>Understanding Income Statement</h4>

<p>Assets, liability, and equity are the three main components of the balance sheet.</p>

<h5>Assets</h5>

<p>Assets consists of three major aspects: cash, inventories, and accounts receivables.Cash: cash offers protection against tough times, and it also gives companies more options for future growth. Growing cash reserves often signal strong company performance. Inventories are finished products that haven't yet sold. As an investor, you want to know if a company has too much money tied up in its inventory. Receivables are outstanding uncollected bills. Analyzing the speed at which a company collects what it's owed can tell you a lot about its financial efficiency. If a company's collection period is growing longer, it could mean problems ahead.</p>

<h5>Liability</h5>

<p>Liabilities include current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Current liabilities are obligations the firm must pay within a year, such as payments owing to suppliers. Non-current liabilities, meanwhile, represent what the company owes in a year or more time. Typically, non-current liabilities represent bank and bondholder debt. You usually want to see a manageable amount of debt. When debt levels are falling, that's a good sign. Generally speaking, if a company has more assets than liabilities, then it is in decent condition. By contrast, a company with a large amount of liabilities relative to assets ought to be examined with more diligence. Having too much debt relative to cash flows required to pay for interest and debt repayments is one way a company can go bankrupt.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Ratio = (current assets - inventories) / current liabilities. </strong></p>

<p>If the ratio is 1 or higher, it says that the company has enough cash and liquid assets to cover its short-term debt obligations.</p>

<h5>Equity</h5>

<p>Equity represents what shareholders own, so it is often called shareholder's equity. As described above, equity is equal to total assets minus total liabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Equity = Total Assets â€“ Total Liabilities</strong></p>

<p>Equity includes paid-in capital, retained earnings. Paid-in capital is the amount of money shareholders paid for their shares when the stock was first offered to the public. It basically represents how much money the firm received when it sold its shares. Retained earnings are a tally of the money the company has chosen to reinvest in the business rather than pay to shareholders. Investors should look closely at how a company puts retained capital to use and how a company generates a return on it.</p>
